# Introduction
Welcome to AHEAD MEDICINE interview project. In this project, I will be working with a dataset of cell samples and using various techniques to analyze and model the data.

To begin, we will be using the notebook make_dataset.ipynb to preview the data and perform feature extraction.

Once you have a good understanding of the data, you can then move on to model.py where you will build, train, and validate the data using machine learning models. This script will take care of all the necessary steps to build a model and evaluate its performance.

Please follow the instructions in the notebooks and script to ensure that the process runs smoothly. We hope you enjoy working on this project and learning about machine learning!
